### Why us

We will respond to any errors found in the code and will use updated code when its outdated. We are verified to code and program and to make sure its up to date. We are making videos on the code at are channel: DogoHax.


CODE:
```markdown
`print("CODE COMING SOON...")`
```

### Version
We are currently in release state so update will come soon and will be running.

### Python?
Python is a free to use programing language used to make many things such as FNAF and other awsome things. Its one of the most popular programing laguages out there!

### Code
We have coded all of this using either notepad++ or the built in editor: IDLE. any is fine. Why not an IDE? IDE's are called anoying when it comes to doing this type or stuff so we try something else instead of Visual Studio and stuff. We use a `TEXT EDITOR!`
